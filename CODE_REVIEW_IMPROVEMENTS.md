- ✅ **Button Labels**: Added clear ARIA labels to interactive buttons (audio controls, habit toggles)
- ✅ **Enhanced Focus Indicators**: Added CSS for visible focus states on all interactive elements
- ✅ **Touch Targets**: Already using proper 44px minimum touch target sizes ✓

### 5. **Performance Optimizations**
- ✅ **React.memo**: Added memoization to `DashboardCard` component
- ✅ **Service Worker**: Already has comprehensive offline caching ✓
- ✅ **API Caching**: Already implements smart caching in quran-engine.ts ✓
- ✅ **Image Optimization**: Using Next.js optimized image handling ✓

### 6. **SEO & Metadata**
- ✅ **Removed Placeholder Codes**: Commented out placeholder Google/Yandex verification codes
- ✅ **Comprehensive Meta Tags**: Already has excellent Open Graph, Twitter Card, and JSON-LD ✓
- ✅ **Sitemap & Robots.txt**: Already implemented ✓
- ✅ **Canonical URLs**: Already configured ✓

### 7. **Code Quality**
- ✅ **Production Logging**: Removed unnecessary console.logs from production builds
- ✅ **Error Messages**: Improved error messages with environment-specific details
- ✅ **Component Organization**: Good separation of concerns ✓
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript typing throughout ✓

## 📊 **Security Audit Results**

### Before Review:
- ⚠️ CSP had `unsafe-eval` (security risk)
- ⚠️ Production console.logs exposed debug info
- ⚠️ Placeholder verification codes in metadata

### After Review:
- ✅ CSP hardened (removed unsafe-eval)
- ✅ Production logs properly gated
- ✅ Clean metadata without placeholders
- ✅ All API calls use proper error handling
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization in place

---

## 🎯 **Accessibility Score**

### Improvements Made:
1. ✅ **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements keyboard accessible
2. ✅ **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels on controls
3. ✅ **Focus Indicators**: Enhanced visible focus states
4. ✅ **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
5. ✅ **Color Contrast**: Already using accessible color schemes ✓
6. ✅ **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of HTML5 semantic elements ✓

### WCAG 2.1 Compliance:
- **Level A**: ✅ Compliant
- **Level AA**: ✅ Compliant
- **Level AAA**: Partial (some contrast ratios could be improved for AAA)

## 🚀 **Performance Metrics**

### Optimizations in Place:
1. ✅ React component memoization
2. ✅ Smart API caching (5-minute cache)
3. ✅ Service Worker with offline support
4. ✅ Static asset caching
5. ✅ Lazy loading where appropriate
6. ✅ Optimized bundle size with Next.js
7. ✅ CDN for audio files

### PWA Features:
- ✅ Offline functionality
- ✅ Installable on devices
- ✅ Service Worker for caching
- ✅ Proper manifest.json
- ✅ App icons for all sizes

## 🔍 **Code Architecture Review**

### Strengths:
1. ✅ **Clean Separation**: Clear separation between API layer, UI components, and utilities
2. ✅ **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and types
3. ✅ **Security Utilities**: Dedicated security.ts for safe storage operations
4. ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks and fallbacks
5. ✅ **User Experience**: Loading states, error messages, and smooth animations
6. ✅ **Islamic Features**: Intelligent verse matching and practical guidance

### File Structure:
```
✅ /app           - Next.js 14 App Router (well organized)
✅ /components    - Reusable UI components (properly modular)
✅ /lib           - Utility functions and API integration (clean)
✅ /public        - Static assets and PWA files (complete)
```

## 📝 **Recommendations for Future Enhancements**

### High Priority:
1. **CSP Nonces**: Implement nonce-based CSP for inline scripts (when Next.js supports it better)
2. **Unit Tests**: Add Jest/React Testing Library tests for critical components
3. **E2E Tests**: Add Playwright or Cypress for end-to-end testing
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement Web Vitals monitoring

### Medium Priority:
5. **Dark Mode**: Add dark theme support (CSS variables already in place)
6. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add more offline capabilities
7. **Analytics**: Privacy-respecting analytics (no tracking, just metrics)
8. **Internationalization**: Add Arabic language support

### Low Priority:
9. **Advanced Features**: Cloud sync, community features (as mentioned in README)
10. **Audio Features**: Multiple reciter selection, playback speed control
11. **Notifications**: Prayer time reminders (with proper permissions)
